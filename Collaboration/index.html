	  <h2>Student internship description</h2>
	  <p>
	  These projects will usually require you to spend from <strong>8 to 12 hours per week</strong> on them, and visit ISI at least once per week. We will provide you with a computer, an office and whatever you need for advancing in your project. If you want to <strong>apply for Directed Research credits</strong>, we may be able to help you as well. These positions are typically <strong>not paid</strong>. However, this may change due to your performance (e.g., we offer you a paid position after the first semester) or available external funding.  
	  </p>
	  <h2>Projects</h2>
	  <p> Below you can find a list of the projects that are available for collaboration with us. I have also included the technologies that you will learn on each of them.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Wiki bots</h3>
	  <p>
	  <a href="https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki">Semantic wikis</a> help us collect and organize knowledge collaboratively. This project aims to design new bots to help us curate, organize and notify us when some of the wikis are updated by someone. These bots could help us determining the user collaboration networks in the wiki, which have been the most popular pages during the last months, summarize the latest edits to create newsletters, etc. <strong>Technologies involved:</strong> <i>PHP, Java/Javascript, SPARQL ,Semantic Media Wiki, Linked Data, OWL</i>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Distributed wiki search</h3>
	  <p>
	  At the moment we have several semantic wikis were different scientists refine and produce contents within their communities. The goal of this project would be to be able to search wiki articles among all of them. Given that each article is described in a machine-readable way, the student would have to collect them, index them and create an application for searching them. The application may be included as part of the wiki. <strong>Technologies involved:</strong> <i>Semantic Media Wiki, OWL, Linked Data, Elastic Search, Javascript</i>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Wiki integration with <a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a></h3>
	  <p>
	  ORCID is slowly becoming the main platform that identifies researchers all over the world and in different domain. ORCID has a public API through which we may connect wiki contributors and retrieve their works. This project would explore how such integration could be done. <strong>Technologies involved:</strong> <i>ORCID API, PHP, Javascript</i>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Create and refine domains in <a href="http://wings-workflows.org/">WINGS</a></h3>
	  <p>
	  Do you have an area of interest from which you want to learn more? Do you want to explore machine learning or deep learning algorithms to analyze data, but there are too many existing frameworks and integrating data is difficult? In this project, the student may select a domain of their choice and add it to the WINGS workflow system to create workflows. This will help you to understand the algorithms, as well as to contribute to a reproducible catalog of software components <strong>Technologies involved:</strong> <i>Shell, OWL, technologies from the domain chosen</i>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Integration of Notebooks and <a href="http://wings-workflows.org/">WINGS</a></h3>
	  <p>
	  The adoption of notebooks (such as <a href="https://ipython.org/notebook.html">Jupyter</a>) to document research has enhanced result sharing. Although notebooks are easy to use, they present several limitations (e.g., knowing specifically the contents of the notebook). This project aims to analyze if it's possible to convert notebooks into workflows and address some of their limitations with them. <strong>Technologies involved:</strong> <i>OWL, SPARQL, notebooks, WINGS</i></li>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3><a href="https://docs.docker.com/">Docker</a> container description</h3>
	  <p>
	  Docker is becoming key for reproducible research. Containers encapsulate programs which can then be executed in other computing infrastructures. However, it is difficult to know what is inside of a Docker image, or whether two Docker images could perform similar functionality. This project aims to describe the software included on a Docker image (particular version, dependencies, license, etc.), so as to facilitate searching. 
	  <strong>Technologies involved:</strong> <i>Docker, OWL, Linked Data</i></li>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Improving Data Narratives</h3>
	  <p><a href="http://dgarijo.github.io/DataNarratives/">Data narratives</a> is a new area of research that aims to describe in experiment results in an automated way. This project aims to improve the current prototype by coming up with new types of narratives, selecting more levels of detail, adapting them according to a particular domain, etc.
	  <strong>Technologies involved:</strong> <i>Java/Javascript, SPARQL, Linked Data, OWL, knowledge representation </i>.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Improving <a href="http://www.ontosoft.org/portal/">OntoSoft</a> usability</h3>
	  <p>OntoSoft is a software registry where people can deposit software metadata. The registry could be improved in different ways to facilitate data collection, like adding a quick search for the metadata properties, suggesting how missing data may be completed, etc. The goal of this project would be to make OntoSoft easier to use, as well as fixing any bug that could arise. 
	  <strong>Technologies involved:</strong> <i>Java, SPARQL, OWL, Json-LD</i>
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Improving <a href="http://www.ontosoft.org/portal/">OnstoSoft</a> semantics</h3>
	  <p>
	  Currently,OntoSoft uses an ontology with very little semantics: most properties have range "String". This was made to facilitate responses from scientist. This project aims to improve the ontology by making it more structured, as well as transforming the collected text into Linked Data resources.
	  <strong>Technologies involved:</strong> <i>Java, SPARQL, OWL, knowledge representation</i>
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Workflow execution annotation</h3>
	  <p>
	  Scientists tend to execute their experiments many different time and make annotations on their notebooks about which parameters work the best. The goal of this project is to allow scientists describing their executions with annotations. The project should use existing annotation frameworks and allow describing a whole WINGS execution.
	  <strong>Technologies involved:</strong> <i>WINGS, Linked Data, annotation framework, OWL</i>
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3><a href="http://zenodo.org/">Zenodo</a> integration</h3>
	  <p>Zenodo is a platform for storing and preserving data and software. The goal of this project is to analyze the Zenodo API to see how we can connect to it to add software code or results. The idea is to be able to connect to our other platforms like the semantic media wiki or OntoSoft to get DOIs for data or code.
	  <strong>Technologies involved:</strong> <i>Zenodo, Java/Javascript, PHP, Linked Data</i>
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>Differences in executions of workflows</h3>
	  <p>In scientific workflows there has been a lot of work in trying to explain why two versions of a workflow are different. However, in this project we aim to explain why two executions of the same workflow are different, and how we can compare one against the other. This comparison might be in terms of the results, metadata or even software versions used. 
	  <strong>Technologies involved:</strong> <i>Linked Data, OWL, WINGS, knowledge representation, (the framework you choose to do the comparison)</i>
